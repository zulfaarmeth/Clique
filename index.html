     <p> This project is a project to discover new skills within the media whilst presenting our identity. Our first sesion was at the school where we just jotted sown some basic ideas about identity.</p>
      
      
      <p>The second session a proffessional photographer came in and we brought in our own objects something personal) we then went to the exhibit we picked (Korea) and found an object that somehow linked with ours.We then went downstairs to the <i>Samsung Centre</i> and did research on the object we found in the mueseum, we then took pictures of our objects and then with them.</p>
      
      <p>On the third session we went straight to the <i>Samsung Centre</i> and met a man who owned a company called <i> Studiobaum </i>, he taught us how to photoshop our images together and create really cool effects we then had to present our 'final pieces' to everyone.
