      <h3> Session 1 </h3>
      <p> This project is a project to discover new skills within the media whilst presenting our identity. Our first sesion was at the school where we just jotted sown some basic ideas about identity.</p>

      <h4>Session 2 </h4>
      <p>The second session a proffessional photographer came in and we brought in our own objects something personal) we then went to the exhibit we picked (Korea) and found an object that somehow linked with ours.We then went downstairs to the <i>Samsung Centre</i> and did research on the object we found in the mueseum, we then took pictures of our objects and then with them.</p>

      <h5> Session 3 </h5>
      <p>On the third session we went straight to the <i>Samsung Centre</i> and met a man who owned a company called <i> Studiobaum </i>, he taught us how to photoshop our images together and create really cool effects we then had to present our 'final pieces' to everyone.</p>
        
        <P>Honestly I expected the trips to be quite tedious since the general stereotypes for a mueseum are, however the trip(s) have completely changed my perspective it's been quite innovative.</p>

      <p>My object was a glass box coveres in the wallpaper of my favourite band (Twenty One Pilots), inside were notes and memoirs. It is connected to the object I picked in the mueseum  (a Korea house model) as one of their music videos (Tear In My Heart) was set in a similiar enviroment. The Korea house was made from sand and paper and my box was made from glass.</p>
